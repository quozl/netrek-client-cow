when server terminates TCP connection,
client hangs, hoping for a callback,
so add a more graceful failure response,
such as a relogin, or re-exec,

Andrew K. Bressen wrote "By the way, the docs for newbies, and maybe the server
login prompt, should probably explicitly explain that logins are per-server;
otherwise I think we might have folks creating, say, a warped login, and then
being pissed when they can't get onto continuum with it."

!!! PLCLEAR is set too often.  Does not need to be set for every draw,
	just for BEEPLITE and moves


The following are projects, ideas, and bugs for anyone who would like
to contribute to BRM.  Please send all patches to brmbugs@crissy.berkeley.edu

These are listed in approximately order of importance.

BUGS:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 


TODO:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Create an rc editor that will allow:
	- keymap, buttonmap editing
	- configuration of all <key>:<value> options
	- window placement
	- choosing fonts
	- macro editing
	- etc...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Create a nicer gtk+ front-end alternative to the current
metaserver window.  Allow launching clients and the rc
editor.  Let players also choose whether they wish to 
connect and play or just observe.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Clean up the source!
Move systems ifdefs to a config file!

  Mostly done by Kurt Siegl COW 1.0, but still not complete.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Enhance macrowindow to include a display of receiver configurable
distress calls.
[I think Nick Trown has finished this and will include it
in future patches]

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Make a mouse button -> control key buttonmap

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Add a meta-command mode into the client, so that people
can imitate what they did with macromode earlier in
terms of RCD.  Further, sensative commands like 'q' and 'Q'
could be mapped to a "safe" meta command mode.

Ex:  Have something like the following in xtrekrc.

metaCommand:  qQ^3

In order to do a fast quit, you then need to hit say 'W'
(or whatever your meta command key is) followed by 'q'.
In order to send the ^3 RCD, need to get into meta-command
mode, then hit ^3.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Allow macros to be assigned to control keys

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Suggestions for new MACRO arguments:
%* automatically abort a macro (ie don't print it) whenever this occurs
%  that is %<SPACE>, this would be used mainly to start a macro
      with blanks in it, ie mac.a.T: %                 BOMB!!

Don't print MACROs if they reduce down via SMARTMACRO to a null message.

Not possible, needs adding.

- See if we can steal any of hadley's or other peoples code to make BRM
run faster.
 
- Streamline the code to speed it up.
 
- Reduce the size of the binary (I dunno how).

[note from jn:  if removing silly features that few people use
 is necessary in order to achieve the above, do it]

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Include Hadley's xtrekrc window into the client.
Steal as much of Hadley's other cool client features as possible.

Just curious, do you have any idea on the status of "galaxy rotate"
with short packets?  It would be really cool if you could get
something like:
galaxy-position:                lower-left
galaxy-direction:               up
So when you enter the game your race is in the lower left corner, and
you will fly upwards to meet your opponents.  Granted, this is
cosmetic but would be really neat.  Do you know if anyone is looking at
this, or is it dead?

Highly related second question: is there (or could there be? :-) a way
to have the received smartdistresses be displayed on 2 separate lines?
Eg:
F4->FED
F4->FED ORG     5 armies        @3 armies
F4->FED CAN     60% fuel        AS
 
Which would be parsed as "F4 is at CAN in an AS with 60% fuel.  He is
heading to ORG@3 with 5 armies.".  The reason for this is that I like
to put a message board on my galactic window, but I can only have a
partial width window (since if it was wider it would block the battle
area).  Shouldn't be too tough, right? :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Come up with some scheme for allowing keymaps to use control and
meta keys, along with TAB, RETURN, DELETE, and other such keys.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Rewrite and update all the documentation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Keep a team stats total in the playerlist, so that teams may
be compared as a whole with one simple quotient.
(idea came from Bharat.Mediratta I think, not sure)

Subject: BRM 2.99pl1: we want the old new player list

Last suggestion : the help window is a mess. A bit of sorting (by themes
for ex.) would be a good idea...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Look for a way to keep metawindow data around so a player who decides
he/she doesn't like the first server connected to, can reconnect
without contacting the metaserver to get another listing.

singleMacro: `

jn responded:
If these are the lines you have in your .xtrekrc, it is not
possible to use the ` key for anything but the specified
macro.  Macros override commands, and singleMacro means you
automatically enter macro mode when that key is hit.  As of
this patchlevel [3.0 beta], keymap is entirely ignored when it comes
to macros and dist.key.name configured distresses.  In future patch levels
we might provide a way to modify and remove whatever singleMacro
is set to, right now editing and reloading xtrekrc is necessary.
